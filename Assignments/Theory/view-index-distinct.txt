Q. Explain DISTINCT, VIEWS and INDEX.

DISTINCT :
	DISTINCT is used in SQL to remove duplicate rows from the result set of a query. When you retrieve data from a table, some columns might have 	duplicate values, and DISTINCT ensures that only unique values are returned.
	Example:
		SELECT DISTINCT Age
		FROM Students;

INDEX:
	An INDEX is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table by allowing the database to quickly locate specific 	rows. Indexes are created on columns that are frequently searched.
	Example:
		CREATE INDEX ind_age
		ON Students (Age);
VIEWS:
	A VIEW is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SQL query. Unlike a physical table, a view doesn't store data itself but provides a way 	to look at data from one or more tables. You can think of it as a saved query that can be treated like a table. We can edit datas in VIEWS only it 	can be viewed. ORDER BY CLAUSE can't be used within VIEWS.
	
	It is useful in case of complicated queries. If we want to reuse it we can create it as a VIEW thus making it easier to access the queries just with 	their names each time we want to access that query.
	Example:
		CREATE VIEW AdultStudents AS
		SELECT Name, Age
		FROM Students
		WHERE Age >= 18;
