One-to-One (1:1) Relationship
A one-to-one relationship exists when one record in a table is related to only one record in another table. This type of relationship is often used when there is a unique association between two entities.

One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship
A one-to-many relationship exists when one record in a table is related to multiple records in another table. This type of relationship is often used when there is a hierarchical or parent-child association between entities.

Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship
A many-to-many relationship exists when multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table. This type of relationship is often used when there is a complex association between entities.

Many-to-One (M:1) Relationship
A many-to-one relationship is similar to a one-to-many relationship, but with the direction reversed. It exists when multiple records in one table are related to only one record in another table.
