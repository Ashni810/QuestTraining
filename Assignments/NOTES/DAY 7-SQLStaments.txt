SQL Statement Types

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating data stored in relational database management systems. There are several types of SQL statements, which can be broadly categorized into the following:

1. Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements
These statements are used to define and modify the structure of a database.

CREATE: Creates a new database, table, index, or other database object.
ALTER: Modifies the structure of an existing database object.
DROP: Deletes a database object.
TRUNCATE: Deletes all rows from a table and resets the auto-incrementing ID.
Example:

CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);

ALTER TABLE customers
ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);
DROP TABLE customers;

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML) Statements
These statements are used to manipulate data in a database.

INSERT: Inserts new data into a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
DELETE: Deletes data from a table.

Example:
INSERT INTO customers (name, email, phone)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com', '123-456-7890');

UPDATE customers
SET name = 'Jane Doe'
WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM customers
WHERE id = 1;

3. Data Query Language (DQL) Statements
These statements are used to retrieve data from a database.

SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
FROM: Specifies the tables to retrieve data from.
WHERE: Filters data based on conditions.
GROUP BY: Groups data by one or more columns.
HAVING: Filters grouped data based on conditions.
ORDER BY: Sorts data in ascending or descending order.
LIMIT: Limits the number of rows returned.

Example:
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA'
ORDER BY name ASC
LIMIT 10;

4. Data Control Language (DCL) Statements
These statements are used to control access to a database.

GRANT: Grants privileges to a user or role.
REVOKE: Revokes privileges from a user or role.

Example:
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
ON customers
TO 'john'@'localhost';

REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
ON customers
FROM 'john'@'localhost';

5. Transaction Control Language (TCL) Statements
These statements are used to manage transactions in a database.

COMMIT: Commits a transaction.
ROLLBACK: Rolls back a transaction.
SAVEPOINT: Creates a savepoint in a transaction.

Example:
COMMIT:-
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO customers (name, email, phone)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com', '123-456-7890');
COMMIT;

ROLLBACK:-
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO customers (name, email, phone)
VALUES ('Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com', '987-654-3210');
ROLLBACK;
